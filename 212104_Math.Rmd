## Mathematical Models for Network Graphs

1. By a model for a network graph we mean effectively a collection

$$
\Big \{ 
P_\theta (G), \; G \in \mathcal G \; \; : \; \; \theta \in \Theta
\Big \}
$$

이때 

where $G$ 는 가능한 그래프들의 collection (혹은 ‘ensemble’), $P_\theta$는 $G$의 확률분포 (간단하게 쓰면 $\cdot_\theta$ 생략하고 $P$만 씀), $\theta$는 $\Theta$ 내부에서 가능한 값들 안에서 펼쳐져있는 (ranging over) 패러미터들(패러미터값들)의 벡터.


2. Variety of Purposes
• The testing for ‘significance’ of a pre-defined characteristic(s) in a given network graph
• The study of proposed mechanisms for generating certain commonly observed properties in real-world
networks (such as broad degree distributions or small-world effects),
• The assessment of potential predictive factors of relational ties.
3. The richness of network graph modeling derives largely from how we choose to specify P(·), with
methods in the literature ranging from the simple to the complex.
4. It is useful for our purposes to distinguish, broadly speaking, between models defined more from (i)
a mathematical perspective, versus (ii) a statistical perspective.
• Those of the former class tend to be simpler in nature and more amendable to mathematical analysis
yet, at the same time, do not always necessarily lend themselves well to formal statistical techniques
of model fitting and assessment.
• On the other hand, those of the latter class typically are designed to be fit to data, but their
mathematical analysis can be challenging in some cases.
• Nonetheless, both classes of network graph models have their uses for analyzing network graph
data.
