## ERGM for Dynamic Networks

<pic>

However, a need for statistical models representing the evolving phenomena ⇒ ”Dynamic Models” with a temporal structure

### Temporal ERGM

ERGM → TERGM → STERGM
One-step transition probability $(t-1) → (t)$ (Markov Assumption)

$$
P_{\eta, g} \Big ( Y^t = y^t \Big | Y^{t-1} \; \; ; \; \; \theta \Big ) = \frac{\exp \Big \{ \eta(\theta) \cdot g(y^t, y^{t-1})\Big  \}}{c_{\eta, h}(\theta, y^{t-1})}
$$



TERGM: Temporal ERGM ⇒ The network at time $t$ is a single draw from an ERGM conditional on the network at time $t − 1$ (and possibly time $t − 2$)

Simplify a statistical model for evolving social networks is to make a Markov assumption on the network from one time step to the next.

If $A^t$ is the weight matrix representation of a single-relation social network at time $t$, then we might make the assumption that $A^t$ is independent of $A^1, \cdots, A^{t-2}$ if we given $A^{t-1}$.

$$
P\Big(A^2, A^3, \cdots, A^t \Big | A^1 \Big ) = P\Big(A^t \Big | A^{t-1} \Big ) P\Big(A^{t-1} \Big | A^{t-2} \Big ) \cdots P\Big(A^2 \Big | A^1 \Big ) \tag{Temporal ERGM}
$$

Given our Markov assumption, one natural way to generalize ERGMs for evolving networks is to assume $A^t \vert A^{t-1}$ admits an ERGM representation.


Specify a function $\Psi : \mathbb R_{n \times n} \times \mathbb R_{n \times n} \rightarrow \mathbb R^k$, which can be understood as a temporal potential over cliques across two time-adjacent networks, and parameter vector $\theta \in \mathbb R^k$, such that the conditional pdf has the following form:

$$
P \bigg( A^t \Big | A^{t-1}, \theta \bigg) = \frac{1}{\kappa(\theta, A^{t-1})} \exp \left\{ \theta' \Psi \left ( A^t, A^{t-1} \right ) \right\}
$$


In particular, we will be especially interested in the special case of these models in which


$$
\Psi \left ( A^t, A^{t-1} \right ) = \sum_{ij}\Psi_{ij} \left ( A^t_{ij}, A^{t-1} \right )
$$

This form of the temporal potential function represents situations where the conditional distribution of $A^t | A^{t-1}$ factors over the entries $A^t_{ij}$ of $A^t$.


##### Network Statistics for Temporal ERGM

Density: The number of ties in the network as a whole.


Stability: The tendency of a link that does exist at time $t − 1$ to continue existing at time $t$.

Reciprocity: The tendency of a link from $i$ to $j$ to result in a link from $j$ to $i$ at the next time step.

Transitivity: The tendency of a tie from $i$ to $j$ and from $j$ to $k$ to result in a tie from $i$ to $k$ at the next time step.


#### Estimation

Use the sequence of observed networks, $N^1  , N^2 , \cdots, N^T$, to find an estimator $\hat \theta$ that is close to the actual parameter value $\theta$.

The normalizing constant is computationally intractable, often making explicit solutions of MLE difficult.

Use MCMC stochastic approximation to estimate parameters.

Let

where expectations are taken over the **random variable $N^t$**, the network at time $t$.

Note that

The expectations can be approximated by Gibbs sampling from the conditional distributions.

Perform an unconstrained optimization procedure akin to Newton’s method: Approximate the expectations, update parameter values in the direction that increases the likelihood, repeat until convergence.

#### Degeneracy of Temporal ERGMs

In the simple case where the transition distribution factors over the edges, it turns out these models avoid such problems entirely. 

The intuitive reason for this is that, since the edges of $A^t$ are conditionally independent given $A^{t−1}$, as long as the individual conditional distributions for the $A^t_{ij}$ given $A^{t−1}$ are not too extreme, the conditional entropy of $A^t$ given $A^{t−1}$ should be large, and thus the entropy of $A^t$ itself must be large.

Of course, this argument only works if the dependence of $A^t$ on $A^{t−1}$ is not too strong, and the strength of this dependence can be controlled by the magnitudes of the parameters.

Calculate it for equivalence classes of graphs which can be analytically shown to have identical probability values, and weight each class according to its size in the entropy calculation.

For the first plot, since the conditional probability of $A^2$ given $A^1$ is only a function of how many edges are present in $A^2$ and how many $ij$ values have $A^2_{ij} = A^1_{ij}$, and since the edges of $A^1$ are exchangeable, we can write the marginal distribution of $A^2$ purely in terms of the number of edges.

Thus we need only calculate $n(n − 1)$ probability values, and the entropy is a weighted sum, where the weights are combinatorial quantities reflecting the number of graphs with that many edges.

### Separable Temporal ERGM

STERGM = A Separable Model for Dynamic Network

Dynamic: social networks that evolve over time
Time(discrete): $\cdots (t-2) → (t-1) → (t) → \cdots$
Shows longitudinal properties based on the ERGM

Separable
	formation : new ties
	duration : lasting ties

- Temporal ERGM Interpretation

However, caution must be used in interpreting their parameters.

Property1: incidence of ties (the rate at which new ties are formed)
Property2: duration of ties (how long they tend to last once they do)

- Network statstic
(ex) edge count $g(y^t , y^{t-1}) = | y^t |$

coefficient on $g$ $prop$ possibility of a network with many ties

But, this term simultaneously increases the weight of preservation of extant ties (fewer dissolved) ⇒ Both incidence and duration ↑

The two-sided nature of these effects tends to muddle parameter interpretation. ⇒ STERGM which separates the incidence and duration of ties and allows for the separate interpretation.

+ : incidence/tie formation $y^+ = y^{t-1} \cup y^t$
– : duration/tie dissolution $y^- = y^{t-1} \cap y^t \Rightarrow y^t = y^- \cup (y^+ \setminus y^{t-1})$
